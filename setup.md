This course is a short introduction to programming in Python, and we wouldn't want you to spend half of it getting Python installed and ready to go.

Instead, we provide you with a running, web-based, Python environment (JupyterLab) thanks to [Binder](https://jupyter.org/binder). This means the only thing you have to do is clicking on the link below to start programming in Python!

[Access the Python environment.](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/LozRiviera/oxber_python_notebook/HEAD?filepath=for_live_coding.ipynb)
