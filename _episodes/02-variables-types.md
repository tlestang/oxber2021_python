## Use variables to store values.

*   **Variables** are names for values.
*   In Python the `=` symbol assigns the value on the right to the name on the left.
*   The variable is created when a value is assigned to it.
*   Here, Python assigns an age to a variable `age`
    and a name in quotes to a variable `first_name`.

    ~~~
    age = 42
    first_name = 'Ahmed'
    ~~~
    {: .language-python}

*   Variable names
    * can **only** contain letters, digits, and underscore `_` (typically used to separate words in long variable names)
    * cannot start with a digit
    * are **case sensitive** (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
*   Variable names that start with underscores like `__alistairs_real_age` have a special meaning
    so we won't do that until we understand the convention.

## Use `print` to display values.

*   Python has a built-in function called `print` that prints things as text.
*   Call the function (i.e., tell Python to run it) by using its name.
*   Provide values to the function (i.e., the things to print) in parentheses.
*   To add a string to the printout, wrap the string in single or double quotes.
*   The values passed to the function are called **arguments**

~~~
print(first_name, 'is', age, 'years old')
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
Ahmed is 42 years old
~~~
{: .output}

*   `print` automatically puts a single space between items to separate them.
*   And wraps around to a new line at the end.

## Variables must be created before they are used.

*   If a variable doesn't exist yet, or if the name has been mis-spelled,
    Python reports an error. (Unlike some languages, which "guess" a default value.)

~~~
print(last_name)
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-1-c1fbb4e96102> in <module>()
----> 1 print(last_name)

NameError: name 'last_name' is not defined
~~~
{: .error}

*   The last line of an error message is usually the most informative.
*   We will look at error messages in detail [later]({{ page.root }}/15-scope/#reading-error-messages).

## Variables can be used in calculations.

*   We can use variables in calculations just as if they were values.
    *   Remember, we assigned the value `42` to `age` a few lines ago.

~~~
age = age + 3
print('Age in three years:', age)
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
Age in three years: 45
~~~
{: .output}

## Use an index to get a single character from a string.

*   The characters (individual letters, numbers, and so on) in a string are
    ordered. For example, the string `'AB'` is not the same as `'BA'`. Because of
    this ordering, we can treat the string as a list of characters.
*   Each position in the string (first, second, etc.) is given a number. This
    number is called an **index** or sometimes a subscript.
*   Indices are numbered from 0.
*   Use the position's index in square brackets to get the character at that
    position.

~~~
atom_name = 'helium'
print(atom_name[0])
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
h
~~~
{: .output}

## Use a slice to get a substring.

*   A part of a string is called a **substring**. A substring can be as short as a
    single character.
*   An item in a list is called an element. Whenever we treat a string as if it
    were a list, the string's elements are its individual characters.
*   A slice is a part of a string (or, more generally, any list-like thing).
*   We take a slice by using `[start:stop]`, where `start` is replaced with the
    index of the first element we want and `stop` is replaced with the index of
    the element just after the last element we want.
*   Mathematically, you might say that a slice selects `[start:stop)`.
*   The difference between `stop` and `start` is the slice's length.
*   Taking a slice does not change the contents of the original string. Instead,
    the slice is a copy of part of the original string.

~~~
atom_name = 'sodium'
print(atom_name[0:3])
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
sod
~~~
{: .output}

## Use the built-in function `len` to find the length of a string.

~~~
print(len('helium'))
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
6
~~~
{: .output}

*   Nested functions are evaluated from the inside out,
     like in mathematics.

## Python is case-sensitive.

*   Python thinks that upper- and lower-case letters are different,
    so `Name` and `name` are different variables.
*   There are conventions for using upper-case letters at the start of variable names so we will use lower-case letters for now.

## Use meaningful variable names.

*   Python doesn't care what you call variables as long as they obey the rules
    (alphanumeric characters and the underscore).

~~~
flabadab = 42
ewr_422_yY = 'Ahmed'
print(ewr_422_yY, 'is', flabadab, 'years old')
~~~
{: .language-python}

*   Use meaningful variable names to help other people understand what the program does.
*   The most important "other person" is your future self.

## Every value has a type.

*   Every value in a program has a specific type.
*   Integer (`int`): represents positive or negative whole numbers like 3 or -512.
*   Floating point number (`float`): represents real numbers like 3.14159 or -2.5.
*   Character string (usually called "string", `str`): text.
    *   Written in either single quotes or double quotes (as long as they match).
    *   The quote marks aren't printed when the string is displayed.

## Use the built-in function `type` to find the type of a value.

*   Use the built-in function `type` to find out what type a value has.
*   Works on variables as well.
    *   But remember: the *value* has the type --- the *variable* is just a label.

~~~
print(type(52))
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
<class 'int'>
~~~
{: .output}

~~~
fitness = 'average'
print(type(fitness))
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
<class 'str'>
~~~
{: .output}

## Types control what operations (or methods) can be performed on a given value.

*   A value's type determines what the program can do to it.

~~~
print(5 - 3)
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
2
~~~
{: .output}

~~~
print('hello' - 'h')
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-2-67f5626a1e07> in <module>()
----> 1 print('hello' - 'h')

TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'str' and 'str'
~~~
{: .error}

## You can use the "+" and "*" operators on strings.

*   "Adding" character strings concatenates them.

~~~
full_name = 'Ahmed' + ' ' + 'Walsh'
print(full_name)
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
Ahmed Walsh
~~~
{: .output}

*   Multiplying a character string by an integer _N_ creates a new string that consists of that character string repeated  _N_ times.
    *   Since multiplication is repeated addition.

~~~
separator = '=' * 10
print(separator)
~~~

{: .output}

## Strings have a length (but numbers don't).

*   The built-in function `len` counts the number of characters in a string.

~~~
print(len(full_name))
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
11
~~~
{: .output}

*   But numbers don't have a length (not even zero).

~~~
print(len(52))
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-3-f769e8e8097d> in <module>()
----> 1 print(len(52))

TypeError: object of type 'int' has no len()
~~~
{: .error}

## <a name='convert-numbers-and-strings'></a> Must convert numbers to strings or vice versa when operating on them.

*   Cannot add numbers and strings.

~~~
print(1 + '2')
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-4-fe4f54a023c6> in <module>()
----> 1 print(1 + '2')

TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'
~~~
{: .error}

*   Not allowed because it's ambiguous: should `1 + '2'` be `3` or `'12'`?
*   Some types can be converted to other types by using the type name as a function.

~~~
print(1 + int('2'))
print(str(1) + '2')
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
3
12
~~~
{: .output}

## Can mix integers and floats freely in operations.

*   Integers and floating-point numbers can be mixed in arithmetic.
    *   Python 3 automatically converts integers to floats as needed.

~~~
print('half is', 1 / 2.0)
print('three squared is', 3.0 ** 2)
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
half is 0.5
three squared is 9.0
~~~
{: .output}

## Variables only change value when something is assigned to them.

*   If we make one cell in a spreadsheet depend on another,
    and update the latter,
    the former updates automatically.
*   This does **not** happen in programming languages.

~~~
first = 1
second = 5 * first
first = 2
print('first is', first, 'and second is', second)
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
first is 2 and second is 5
~~~
{: .output}

*   The computer reads the value of `first` when doing the multiplication,
    creates a new value, and assigns it to `second`.
*   After that, `second` does not remember where it came from.
