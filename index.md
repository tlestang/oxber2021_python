This is a website with the contents for the Introduction to Python given at the 2021 Oxford Berlin Summer School on Open Research. 

This is a stripped down mix of the two Python [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) courses:
- [Programming with Python](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/)
- [Plotting and Programming in Python](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/)

<!-- this is an html comment -->

This course is a short introduction to programming in Python, and we wouldn't want you to spend half of it getting Python installed and ready to go.

Instead, we provide you with a running, web-based, Python environment (JupyterLab) thanks to [Binder](https://jupyter.org/binder). This means the only thing you have to do is clicking on the link below to start programming in Python!
